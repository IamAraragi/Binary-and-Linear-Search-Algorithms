# Binary-and-Linear-Search-Algorithms
Implementation of binary and linear search algorithms

I wrote this code for my lab project.

From this lab project, I have found that the binary search algorithm is considerably faster than linear search algorithm. From the above graph we can clearly see that for different size of the inputs the binary search algorithm takes almost no time whereas the for linear search algorithm it increases with the increase in input size. Sometimes the linear search algorithm can find the input faster even if the input size is increased, if the data we are searching is in the beginning.
Although the binary search algorithm is faster than the linear search algorithm, it has a major limitation. Binary search algorithm can only be used for the sorted data. It doesnâ€™t for an unsorted data. So to search the input we have to sort the unsorted data and this may take some time depending on the size of data.
